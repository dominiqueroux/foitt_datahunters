# DataHunters solution for challenge #8 Empower Citizens with Open Government Data


## How to get it up and running ##

1. Set-up [docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) and [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
2. In the repo directory run: `docker-compose up`

This will start the back-end and the front-end as docker containers.

The front-end will then be reachable via http://localhost:8000
